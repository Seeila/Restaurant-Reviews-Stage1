# Restaurant Reviews Stage 1
---
#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, we had to convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In this first stage, we have to take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be **responsive on different sized displays** and accessible for **screen reader** use. We also have to add a **service worker** to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.

### Specification

We have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. Our job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.

### Installing the app
1. Python is needed for the server. If you don't have it installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
2. Run the server with the command python -m http.server 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use).
3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`
4. This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). With a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
